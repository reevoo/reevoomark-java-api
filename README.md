##Installation

Add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:

``` xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.reevoo.taglib</groupId>
    <artifactId>reevoo-taglib</artifactId>
    <version>1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

##Implementation

Include the relevant CSS. For product reviews use:

``` html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://mark.reevoo.com/stylesheets/reevoomark/embedded_reviews.css" type="text/css" />
```

Include your customer specific Reevoo JavaScript:

``` html
<script src="http://mark.reevoo.com/reevoomark/<TRKREF>.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

Include the taglib:

``` java
<%@ taglib prefix="reevoo" uri="http://reevoo.com/java-taglib/v1" %>
```

Render embedded review content. Make sure to replace `<SKU>` and `<TRKREF>` with the appropriate values:

``` java
<reevoo:mark sku="<SKU>" trkref="<TRKREF>" baseURI="http://mark.reevoo.com/reevoomark/embeddable_reviews.html" />
```

It is also possible to specify locale and the number of reviews you'd like in the baseURI:

``` java
<reevoo:mark sku="<SKU>" trkref="<TRKREF>" baseURI="http://mark.reevoo.com/reevoomark/fr-FR/10/embeddable_reviews.html" />
```

## Tracking

If you display the reviews in a tabbed display, or otherwise require visitors to your site to click an element before seeing the embedded reviews, add the following onclick attribute to track the clickthroughs:

``` html
  onclick="ReevooMark.track_click_through(‘<SKU>’)”
```

## Overall rating

If you get in touch with Reevoo, we can switch an overall ratings section on at the top of inline reviews on a per-retailer basis. This contains an overall score, a summary and the score breakdowns. Your container must be at least 650px for the score breakdowns to be shown. The absolute minimum width for inline reviews is 350px.
